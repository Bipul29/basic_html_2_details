                <p>Sippi Arsuang is one of the highest peaks in Bangladesh with a height of approximately 2939 feet
                    which is the
                    10th highest peak in Bangladesh. SippiArsuang Hill is located in the foothills of Roangchhari
                    Upazila in the
                    Bandarban District of Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh. Located in Roangchhari, this hill can be
                    an ideal trek
                    for beginners.
                <blockquote>It also takes less time. This trek can be completed in just three days. The Sippy
                    Trail from
                    Roninpara is slowly skyrocketing. There are three hilltops in the Sippy Range. Although the main
                    summit peak is
                    recognizable from a distance, the closer you get to it, the more you will start playing hide and
                    seek behind the
                    other peaks to give dust to your eyes. A total of four steps, meaning you have to cross four hills
                    to reach
                    Sippi Peak.</blockquote>
                Several neighborhoods can be seen from Sippy including Shankhamuni Para. There was a British camp at
                the top of
                Sippi or before. On the way to Roninpara, you have to go down a steep hill, from which you can see
                Sippy. It is
                heard that there are tigers in the forest at the top of Sippi. Besides, deer and pigs are easily
                available in
                that forest. In December 2015, deer were caught in a trap in Sippy’s forest. Later, the hunters went
                to fetch
                the deer and found the remains. However, no one has seen a tiger in this hill.</p>
